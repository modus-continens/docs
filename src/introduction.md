# Introduction

Modus is a language for building [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) images. Modus uses logic programming to address pain points of Dockerfiles: implementing complex build logic, parallelising builds, optimising image size, and maintaining build definitions.

Modus uses semantic versioning; until version 1.0 is declared, breaking changes are possible. The current version, 0.1, is a preview release. We welcome bug reports and feature requests submitted through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mechtaev/modus/issues).
